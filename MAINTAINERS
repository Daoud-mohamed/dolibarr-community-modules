List of maintainers and how to submit kernel changes
====================================================

This file is using the stnadard format for MAINTAINERS files.
You can find here the name of main maintainers of each module of this repository.

Submission of patchs for code must be done using a PR at the repository system provided in the T entry in
the list Maintener list lower.

Note that this is only list of a few modules validated by the Dolibarr foundation. Most modules are completely
under control of their maintainers outside of this repository. See https://www.dolistore.com for a complete list
of external modules.


Descriptions of section entries and preferred order

	M: Name or Mailof main maintainer
	S: *Status*, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
	W: *Web-page* with status/info
	T: *SCM* tree type and location.
	   Type is one of: git, hg, quilt, stgit, topgit
	F: *Files* and directories wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	moduleabc/dir/	all files in and below moduleabc/dir
	   F:	*/dir/*		all files in "any top level directory"/dir
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.
	X: *Excluded* files and directories that are NOT maintained, same
	   rules as F:. Files exclusions are tested before file matches.
	   Can be useful for excluding a specific subdirectory, for instance:
	   F:	moduleabc/
	   X:	moduleabc/subdir/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
