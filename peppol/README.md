## What is PEPPOL ?

(from wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEPPOL)

PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) is a set of specifications maintained by the OpenPEPPOL non-profit organisation with the aim of standardizing cross-border, electronically supported procurement procedures. It features, among other things, electronic invoicing. In addition to specifications PEPPOL consists of a delivery network.

It started off as a development project with the same name under the European union Competitiveness and Innovation Programme from May 2008 to August 2012. The EU funded the PEPPOL programme by over 15 million Euros.

The goal of the project was to solve interoperability issues in electronic public procurement by aligning business processes using common standards, addressing common legal issues and developing open source technologies. Agreement on the common standards for document content and on the technical aspects was reached through consensus amongst all consortium members.

After the project ended the OpenPEPPOL Association was founded in Belgium to continue the work on the framework.
